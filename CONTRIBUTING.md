Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this library!  This is a small project maintained by yours truly and it is meant to be easy and fun to use.  I'm a hobbiest and my day job is distinctly outside tech spheres so what I've done here may not make any sense to people who actually know what they're doing.  Contributions that refine and inprove the API or expand upon MiP's capabilities are highly encouraged.  Equally important are contributions that document this project or clarify confusing issues.  If you can improve this library through code or documention or if you've identified a bug and have a fix, please send a pull request.
